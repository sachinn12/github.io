						<div class="recommendation-content">
							<p>
								I am writing this letter of recommendation for Mr. Sachin Yadav who I have been supervising in different functions since October 2023. Mr. Yadav has primarily worked as a software developer in my university-based startup focused on human and computational labeling of textual data. Above that, he has carried out several research projects on textual annotation with large language models under my supervision. He has shown considerable programming and intellectual skills in carrying out the work I supervised and has proven to be extraordinarily reliable, responsible, and flexible. Whenever he could not solve a problem directly, he searched proactively for solutions. Hence, I highly recommend him to future employers.

								Mr. Yadav worked on the project "Cooperative Approaches for Successful Learning of Teacher Training Students, Teachers, and Students in Vocational Education in the Context of Challenges Posed by Digitalization" (short: KoopAL DIGITAL) from July 1, 2023, to August 31, 2023. In this context, he collaborated with a colleague to create a digital representation of the I4.0 learning factory at the Vocational School Backnang, resulting in an interactive and online-accessible I4.0 learning platform. Mr. Yadav demonstrated commitment and was willing to delve into new topics. He completed the assigned work packages on time and contributed to finding solutions throughout the project. His behavior towards colleagues and supervisors was always impeccable and marked by great courtesy. We wish Mr. Yadav all the best for his future career and would be pleased to welcome him back at any time.</p>
